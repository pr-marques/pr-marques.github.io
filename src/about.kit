        <p>Hi, I’m Mariana! ⭐️ A Digital Product Designer based in Lisbon, exploring the intersection of people, systems, and design. With a background in Communication Design, I approach problems through a critical and socially engaged lens. I’m drawn to environments where dialogue, collaboration, and open critique push ideas further.</p>

        <p>Naturally introspective and observant, I listen closely. This quiet attention helps me surface deeper insights and navigate ambiguity with care. I’m driven by curiosity and imagination, often connecting ideas across disciplines. I design with heart as much as with logic. Empathy is a constant guide in my process, leading me toward accessible, inclusive, and user-centered outcomes. At the same time, I remain adaptable and open to change, trusting the process of exploration and iteration to uncover the right direction.</p>
